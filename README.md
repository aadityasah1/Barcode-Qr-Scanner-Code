Introduction Of This Program
->This program is basically a webcam-based barcode scanner program that leverages the capabilities of common webcams found in most computers, providing a versatile and user-friendly tool for various applications.

Dependencies
->The main dependencies for the program are:-
OpenCV(Open sourceComputer Vision Library):- OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision library that provides tools for image and video processing. In this program, it is used for capturing video frames from the webcam, image processing, and displaying the results.

ZBar:- ZBar is a barcode and QR code scanning library. It allows the program to decode barcodes from the webcam feed.

How does it work?
->The program captures the webcam feed, processes the images using computer vision techniques, and decodes barcode information using the ZBar library. Real-time feedback is provided, displaying the scanned barcode data on the screen.

Benefits
->Cost Effective, Accessibility, Versatile, User-Friendly, Customizable.

What can be made better?
->By implementing or enhancing several features like:- Error Handling, Multithreading, User Feedback, Performance Optimization, User Interface Improvement.

Resources which you took help from
->I took help from some youtube videos for learning resources and some Github Repo.

Why do we do this?
A project like the webcam-based barcode scanner serves the purpose of helping others in various ways like:- Learning Opportunity, Open source collaboration, Practical Example, Addressing common challenges, Practices.


Here is the code for this program:-

```# using packages 
#pip install opencv-python 
#pip install pydub 
#pip install pyzbar 

import cv2
from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode

# capture webcam 
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while cap.isOpened():
    success,frame = cap.read()
    # flip the image like mirror image 
    frame  = cv2.flip(frame,1)
    # detect the barcode 
    detectedBarcode = decode(frame)
    # if no any barcode detected 
    if not detectedBarcode:
        print("No any Barcode Detected")
    
    # if barcode detected 
    else:
        # codes in barcode 
        for barcode in detectedBarcode:
            # if barcode is not blank 
            if barcode.data != "":
                cv2.putText(frame,str(barcode.data),(50,50),cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_COMPLEX,2,(0,255,255),2)
                cv2.imwrite("code.png",frame)
                


    cv2.imshow('scanner' , frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):
        break```
